For this assignment, you will complete the MapReduce template that Dr. Havens went through in class and add to it as necessary to complete the tasks. All the sections of the MapReduce must be completed (including those went over in class).

Submit your work as a Jupyter notebook in PDF or HTML.

Part 1) (20 points) Complete the in-class work in the MapReduce notebook.

Part 2) (20 points) Write a reducer which returns the top n words from list of document files. (We started this in class.)

Part 3) (30 points) Write a mapper and reducer to process all the files available at https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

The output of your reducer should be a list of the 'n' most common names that start with a given letter from a list of files input to the map_reduce function. For example, one should be able to use your map_reduce implementation to find the 10 most popular names that start with 'k' from the files ["yob1967.txt", "yob1968.txt", "yob1969.txt"]. Note that if there aren't 10 names that start with 'k' then your reducer should only return the number that exist; it should not produce an error.

Part 4) (30 points) Write a mapper and reducer that returns the top 'n' names from a list of files that contain (anywhere within the name) a given string. For example, if I want the top 10 names that contain 'sty' from files ["yob1967.txt", "yob1968.txt", "yob1969.txt"], it could return names such as 'Misty', 'Christy', 'Astyr', 'Stymus', 'Pasty', etc. (I just made those up; that isn't actually the answer.)
